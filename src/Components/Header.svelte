    <p>I've been extremely lucky to work as both a developer and consultant for some <i>fantastic</i> companies over the last 12 years, creating iPad apps, web apps, awardwinning VFX pipeline tools, and game-changing design applications, all of which push the boundaries of what an end user can achieve.</p>
    <p>I love making data flow between applications in occasionally odd but incredibly useful ways. As such, the majority of my freelance work today involves either prototyping new and unique workflows between existing technologies, or increasing the accessibility of disparate and often esoteric datasets, by creating new applications along with the pipelines necessary to support them.</p>
    <p>A selection of the projects I have worked on are presented below, covering a wide range of platforms, coding languages, and deliverables. Whilst the majority of these projects are for clients in the VFX and design industries, several of my more recent freelance projects also involve exploring creative ways of working with, and increasing the accessibility of, scientific data.</p>
    <p>I live in <b>Bristol, UK</b>, and can be contacted at <span class="text-cv font-bold tracking-wider">matt@mattbrealey.com</span>.</p>

<!-- <p>Whilst a large percentage of my freelance work currently involves both the Design and VFX industries, over the past several years I have also been using my skillset to develop novel applications to both process and increase the accessibility of publically available raw space imagery. Once such example of this is AreoBrowser, a web-app for viewing thousands of 3D models of the Martian surface.</p> -->
